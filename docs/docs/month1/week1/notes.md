# Week 1: C# Basics

## Introduction
Welcome to Week 1 of your 3-month journey to mastering ASP.NET and Next.js! This week focuses on the fundamentals of C#, a crucial foundation for ASP.NET Core. By the end of this week, you'll be comfortable with basic C# concepts, setting the stage for the weeks ahead.

## Learning Objectives
- Set up a development environment for C#.  
- Write and run basic programs.  
- Understand and use variables, data types, control structures, and methods.  
- Get introduced to classes and objects, preparing for fresher developer interviews.

## Daily Schedule
Below is the detailed schedule for each day of the week, including specific tasks and reference materials.

| **Day** | **Topic**                  | **Main Tasks**                                      | **Reference Materials**                                                                 |

| Day 3   | Control Structures         | - Learn if-else, switch, and loops. <br>- Write a program to check even/odd numbers or print a number sequence. | [Control flow in C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/#control-flow), [if-else](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/statements/selection-statements), [switch](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/statements/selection-statements#the-switch-statement), [Loops in C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/statements/iteration-statements) |
| Day 4   | Functions and Methods      | - Read about defining and using methods. <br>- Understand parameters and return types. <br>- Write a program with multiple methods. | [Methods in C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/tutorials/define-and-use-functions), [Parameters and arguments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/method-parameters) |
| Day 5   | Classes and Objects (Intro)| - Read about defining classes and creating objects. <br>- Understand basic OOP. <br>- Define a "Person" class and create an object. | [Classes and objects in C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/types/#classes-and-objects), [Defining classes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/class), [Creating objects](https://learn.msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/799e87d8(v=vs.110).aspx) |

## Additional Resources

- [Official C# Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp)  
- [Stack Overflow for C#](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/c%23)  
- Practice further on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/?topicSlugs=csharp) to reinforce your skills.

## Tips for Review and Interview Preparation
- **Practice Regularly**: Write small programs daily, such as checking even/odd numbers, calculating sums, or creating simple classes.  
- **Daily Review**: Spend 10-15 minutes at the end of each day revisiting key concepts, especially if-else and loops.  
- **Interview Prep**: Practice answering questions like "What’s the difference between int and float?" or "Write a C# program to check if a number is prime."  
- **Take Notes**: Update your notes in `docs/month1/week1/notes.md` in your GitHub repo for easy reference.  
- **Ask Questions**: If stuck, explore forums like Stack Overflow or dive deeper into the documentation.

## Bonus Tip
Here’s a surprise: Practicing on platforms like LeetCode or HackerRank can sharpen your problem-solving skills, giving you an edge in technical interviews. Start with basic problems on loops and conditions!
